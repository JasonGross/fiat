\section{ADT Refinement}

\subsection{Abstraction meets Computations}
Explain how abstraction relations work with our notion of
specification via computations.

\subsubsection{Invariants via Abstraction}
The abstration relation give us representation invariants
with no extra machinery required.

\subsubsection{Finite Differencing}
Lots of opportunity for caching.

\subsubsection{Running Example: switching representation to support
  minimum operation.}
