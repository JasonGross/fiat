\section{Related Work}

\begin{itemize}
\item Datatype Representation Synthesis\cite{Hawkins+2011}: They have an
  autotuner, but there's no real correctness here.
\item Data Refinement in Isabelle/HOL\cite{Lammich+2013, Haftman+2013}
  and Coq\cite{Cohen+2013}: The focus here is on reasoning about
  client code: our concern is deriving correct implementations of
  potentially complicated systems.
\item SpecWare\cite{SpecWare}: This is in spirit the closest to
  what we're doing. Refinement steps are justified by an extraction
  to Isabelle/HOL, and the automation is sketchy. Their interest is in
  deriving complicated algorithms (garbage collector). We are focusing
  on user domains where we can leverage automation.
